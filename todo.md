# TODO

## Further Development

- enforce complex password
- lock account after 3 failed login attempts

### 1. Security Enhancements

#### JWT Implementation
- [ ] Implement JWT key rotation and use asymmetric keys (RSA)
  # Comment: Current implementation uses simple JWT secret. Need to implement key rotation
  # and use RSA keys for better security. This prevents token forgery if secret is compromised.
- [ ] Add token blacklisting for logout functionality
  # Comment: Currently tokens are valid until expiration. Need to implement blacklisting
  # to invalidate tokens on logout or security events.
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
  # Comment: Add refresh tokens to allow users to stay logged in without compromising security.
  # Access tokens should be short-lived while refresh tokens can be longer-lived.

#### Password Security
- [ ] Add password complexity requirements
  # Comment: Implement rules for minimum length, special characters, numbers, etc.
  # This prevents weak passwords that are easy to guess.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for password attempts
  # Comment: Prevent brute force attacks by limiting login attempts per IP/user.
- [ ] Add password history to prevent reuse
  # Comment: Store previous passwords to prevent users from reusing them.
- [ ] Add MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) support
  # Comment: Implement 2FA using TOTP or other methods for additional security.

### 2. Data Protection
- [ ] Add data encryption at rest for sensitive fields
  # Comment: Encrypt sensitive data like passwords, tokens in the database.
- [ ] Implement proper data masking for sensitive information
  # Comment: Mask sensitive data in logs and responses (e.g., partial email/phone).
- [ ] Add audit logging for all sensitive operations
  # Comment: Log all sensitive operations for security and compliance.
- [ ] Add GDPR compliance features
  # Comment: Implement data deletion, export, and consent management.

### 3. API Enhancements
- [ ] Add API versioning
  # Comment: Implement versioning to handle breaking changes gracefully.
- [ ] Implement proper rate limiting
  # Comment: Add rate limiting at API level to prevent abuse.
- [ ] Add request/response validation middleware
  # Comment: Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs.
- [ ] Add standardized error responses
  # Comment: Implement consistent error format and proper HTTP status codes.
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  # Comment: Document API endpoints for better developer experience.

### 4. High Availability
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
  # Comment: Implement connection pooling for better database performance.
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers
  # Comment: Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
- [ ] Add caching layer
  # Comment: Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- [ ] Implement database migrations strategy
  # Comment: Add proper version control for database schema changes.

### 5. Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for all components
  # Comment: Implement comprehensive unit tests for each component.
- [ ] Add more comprehensive integration tests
  # Comment: Add tests for component interactions.
- [ ] Add performance tests
  # Comment: Test system performance under load.
- [ ] Add security tests
  # Comment: Implement security testing (OWASP, etc.).
- [ ] Add chaos testing
  # Comment: Test system resilience under failure conditions.

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation
  # Comment: Document API endpoints, parameters, and responses.
- [ ] Add deployment documentation
  # Comment: Document deployment procedures and requirements.
- [ ] Add operational documentation
  # Comment: Document operational procedures and troubleshooting.
- [ ] Add security documentation
  # Comment: Document security measures and procedures.
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
  # Comment: Document how to contribute to the project.

### 7. Code Quality
- [ ] Add linters and formatters
  # Comment: Implement code quality tools (golangci-lint, etc.).
- [ ] Add code coverage requirements
  # Comment: Set minimum code coverage requirements.
- [ ] Add dependency scanning
  # Comment: Scan for vulnerable dependencies.
- [ ] Add security scanning
  # Comment: Implement security scanning in CI/CD.
- [ ] Add proper CI/CD pipeline
  # Comment: Implement automated testing and deployment.

### 8. Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management
  # Comment: Use secure secret management (Vault, etc.).
- [ ] Implement backup strategy
  # Comment: Set up regular backups and recovery procedures.
